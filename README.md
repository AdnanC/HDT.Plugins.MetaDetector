This Hearthstone Deck Tracker plugin tries to detect what deck opponent is playing based on the cards played. Cards are compared with the most popular decks online and the closest matching decks are displayed. Decks are regulary updated and plugin automatically downloads the latest deck list. 


# Installation

1. Download the latest version from https://github.com/adnanc/HDT.Plugins.MetaDetector/releases
2. Then unzip the release into the HDT Plugins directory (this directory can be opened with Options > Tracker > Plugins > Plugins Folder)
3. The directory should look like Plugins/MetaDetector/[some files]
4. Enable the plugin from Options > Tracker > Plugins. ***If you are already using MetaStats plugin, please disable that, it will cause data conflict***.
5. If the plugin does not show up in that list, right click the '[PLUGINNAME].dll', go into Properties and click "Unblock" at the bottom.
